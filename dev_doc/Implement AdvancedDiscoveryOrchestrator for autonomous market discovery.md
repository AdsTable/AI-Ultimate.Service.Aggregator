# Implement the AdvancedDiscoveryOrchestrator agent for autonomous market discovery:

**Core Features:**
- Multi-source discovery using 6 parallel methods
- AI-powered search strategy generation  
- Intelligent provider validation and confidence scoring
- Integration with existing AIAsyncClient for cost optimization
- Self-learning discovery pattern improvement

**Discovery Methods:**
1. Search engine analysis with AI result validation
2. Regulatory database scanning
3. Competitor network analysis 
4. Social media intelligence gathering
5. Industry report mining
6. News and announcement monitoring

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Use cost-optimized AI routing (Ollama → HuggingFace → Groq → OpenAI)
- Async/await architecture for parallel processing
- Redis caching for discovered provider data
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Integration with existing database models
