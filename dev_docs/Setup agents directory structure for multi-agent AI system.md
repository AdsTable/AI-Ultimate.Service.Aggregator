# Setup agents directory structure for multi-agent AI system

Create the directory structure and base classes for the multi-agent AI discovery system:

- `agents/discovery/` - Discovery orchestrator and specialized discovery agents
- `agents/extraction/` - Content extraction and analysis agents  
- `agents/intelligence/` - Market intelligence and competitive analysis agents
- `agents/base/` - Base classes and shared utilities

Each directory should contain:
- `__init__.py` with proper exports
- Base agent classes with common functionality
- Specialized agent implementations
- Configuration and error handling utilities
