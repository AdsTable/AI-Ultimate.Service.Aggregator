## 1. Initial Screen (http://localhost:8501)
Header: Blue gradient banner with "Service Aggregator - Admin Dashboard"
Sidebar: Control panel with extraction options
Main Area: 4 metric cards showing:
Total Plans: 0 (initially)
Providers: 5 (configured)
Categories: 0 (initially)
Sessions: 0 (initially)

## 2. After First Extraction

✅ Expected Console Output:
✅ Service Extractor initialized
✅ Database initialized
🎯 Starting extraction from: telia.no
🌐 Navigating to https://www.telia.no/privat/mobil/abonnement
✅ Cookie consent handled
🔍 Found 6 potential plan containers
✅ Extracted: Telia Smart - 299 kr
✅ Extracted: Telia Fri - 599 kr
✅ Successfully extracted 6 plans from telia.no
💾 Stored 6 plans in database

## 3. Admin Interface After Extraction

Metrics Update: Total Plans shows actual count (e.g., 6)
Search Results: Table showing extracted plans with columns:
ID, Provider, Name, Category, Price, Features, URL, Extracted At, Confidence
Analytics Charts: Bar charts showing distribution by category and provider
System Status: Green checkmarks indicating active database

## 4. Database Verification

-- You can check the SQLite database directly:
sqlite3 services.db
.tables
-- Should show: plans
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plans;
-- Should show: number of extracted plans

# 🔧 Technical Validation Steps
## Database Validation:

# Check database health
sqlite3 services.db "SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM plans GROUP BY category;"
# Expected: mobile: 15+, electricity: 10+

# Check data quality
sqlite3 services.db "SELECT * FROM plans WHERE monthly_price > 0 LIMIT 5;"
# Expected: Clean data with proper prices

## Interface Validation:

# Check Streamlit health
curl http://localhost:8501/healthz
# Expected: HTTP 200 response

# Check interface responsiveness
# Expected: Page loads in <3 seconds

##Extraction Validation:

# Test extraction accuracy
python -c "
from main import ServiceExtractor
import asyncio
extractor = ServiceExtractor()
plans = asyncio.run(extractor.extract_from_provider('https://www.telia.no/privat/mobil/abonnement'))
print(f'Extracted {len(plans)} plans')
print('Success!' if len(plans) >= 3 else 'Failed!')
"
# Expected: "Extracted 6 plans" "Success!"

This comprehensive plan ensures systematic development with clear validation criteria at each step, leading to a production-ready service aggregator with professional admin interface and reliable extraction capabilities.
